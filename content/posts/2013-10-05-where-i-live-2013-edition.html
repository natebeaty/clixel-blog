<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> (now at v3 beta) is where I’ve spent a good portion of my life over the last 2-&frac12; years. It’s a great cave as far as code caves go.</li>
	<li>Sadly Photoshop CC still sits in my toolbelt, <a href="http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a> is getting so damn good (same with <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/">Pixelmator</a>) but it’s still not quite enough to supplant this required, ever-worsening POS. I pine for the day indie apps kick the crap out of the CC suite.</li>
	<li><a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/">Tweetbot</a> because I spend entirely too much time <a href="https://twitter.com/natebeaty">blathering in 140-char chunks</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://gitx.laullon.com/">GitX (L)</a> because it’s a perfect git GUI. And free. I’ve tried so many and keep coming back to GitX (L).<br/></li>
	<li><a href="http://stuntsoftware.com/onthejob/">On The Job</a> for time tracking &amp; invoicing. It’s not perfect but it’s the closest I could find to my simple needs. For many years I used Billable and only switched because I didn’t like the successor, Profit Train.</li>
	<li>Chromium because I trust Google less every day. It’s always a pain finding a download for this. I can’t even find one now.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.binarynights.com/">ForkLift 2</a> is still in my belt, because there’s nothing quite like it. I still use <a href="http://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> for DockSend. ForkLift has sadly been left to pasture by BinaryNights while they focus on Locko, a 1Password clone.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/">The Hit List</a> is still the best damn to-do app. I don’t opt to pay for the syncing &amp; iOS app. Reminders is my on-the-go queue for tasks that I dump into Hit List when back at the desk.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a> for when you want to navigate MySQL locally. It’s crazy this is free. I just realized you can donate and dropped $10 in the beer fund.</li>
	<li><a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> was a random purchase to compile Less files, but has become an essential tool for Scss compiling, Javascript combining/minimizing, image optimizing, etc. Hilarious version update notes are a bonus.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm2</a> became stable enough to replace Terminal.</li>
	<li><a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a> is the sharpest text-editing knife. Plays nice with Dropbox folder of plain text files.</li>
</ul>
