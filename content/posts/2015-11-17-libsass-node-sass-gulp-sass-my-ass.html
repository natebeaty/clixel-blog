<p>This error:</p>

<pre><code>Error: `libsass` bindings not found. Try reinstalling `node-sass`
</code></pre>

<p>was showing up in older Bedrock projects, causing two devs to pull some hair out—well one of them still has hair—and it turned out to be a simple update of <code>gulp-sass</code> in the packages.json file:</p>

<pre><code>-    "gulp-sass": "^1.3.3",
+    "gulp-sass": "^2.0.0",
</code></pre>

<p><code>npm update</code> and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
