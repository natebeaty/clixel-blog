<p><a href="http://microcosmpublishing.com/">Microcosm</a> asked to add a todo section to their admin, and this is what I came up with after a few half-days of coding (thanks in large part to my good friend <a href="http://mootools.net/">MooTools</a>). They have two shops and a growing staff, and everybody spends quite a bit of time in the admin I built for them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of <a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/">The Hit List</a>, which I believe is just about as perfect a task manager as you could ask for, and I obviously borrowed some ideas. If I had more time to fuss with this, and if it was something <i>I&rsquo;d</i> be using regularly, I&rsquo;d implement full keyboard control and mimic The Hit List even more.</p>
<p>Todo apps feel like the advanced &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo; of programming exercises, akin to Tetris for game developers. I can&rsquo;t believe it took me this long to get to make one.</p>
