<p>I often find myself wanting to use several attributes of a ActiveRecord object in a string, but have until now been unable to track down exactly how to do that.</p>

<p>Say I have this simple model with a custom method:</p>

<pre><code>class Applicant &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    def full_name
      [first_name,last_name].reject{ |e| e.empty? }.join ' '
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>If I want to build an email header using that custom method and a few standard attributes, trying this:</p>

<pre><code>subject = "New Application from %{full_name} at %{city}, %{state}" % @applicant
</code></pre>

<p>will cough up the error:</p>

<p><code>ArgumentError: one hash required</code></p>

<p>Ok, so we need a hash out of our AR object. How about:</p>

<pre><code>subject = "New Application from %{full_name} at %{city}, %{state}" % @applicant.as_json
</code></pre>

<p>gives us this:</p>

<p><code>KeyError: key{full_name} not found</code></p>

<p>Right! We have to add our custom method manually:</p>

<pre><code>subject = "New Application from %{full_name} at %{city}, %{state}" % @applicant.as_json(methods: :full_name)
</code></pre>

<p>Crap! Still failing:</p>

<p><code>KeyError: key{full_name} not found</code></p>

<p>Turns out the hash needs to have keys that are symbols. No fear, <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/Hash/symbolize_keys">symbolize_keys</a> to the rescue:</p>

<pre><code>subject = "New Application from %{full_name} at %{city}, %{state}" % @applicant.as_json(methods: :full_name).symbolize_keys
</code></pre>

<p>And voila:</p>

<p><code>"New Application from Nate Beaty at Chicago, IL"</code></p>

<p>For what seems like such a simple task, this has tripped me up for quite some time, and it&rsquo;s been difficult to Google exactly what was needed to make this happen.</p>
