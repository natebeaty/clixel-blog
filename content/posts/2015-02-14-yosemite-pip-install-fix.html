<p>I was getting compile errors when pip installing anything requiring compilation after upgrading to Yosemite, barfing out all sorts of cryptic nonsense ending with:</p>

<pre><code>error: command '/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.2' failed with exit status 1
</code></pre>

<p>Googling that error didn&rsquo;t help, and I tried all sorts of fixes until I realized the real problem was this line in my <code>~/.bash_profile</code>:</p>

<pre><code>export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.2
</code></pre>

<p>When I removed that, opened a new terminal, reactivated my virtualenv and <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> everything worked perfectly. Hopefully this helps someone else who&rsquo;s been having issues after upgrading to Yosemite and have some lingering bash remnants from earlier dev setups.</p>
