<p>I did a complete wipe and reinstall of macOS High Sierra on my aging 2012 mbp, thinking it would solve all my random woes (false). As I was setting up my dev environment, I was baffled when both Safari and Chrome were redirecting all <code>*.dev</code> domain requests to https. Console showed no 301 redirects. Wth? I thought it was something I messed up in Apache config and spent a few hours beating my head against the keyboard to no avail.</p>

<p>Turns out <code>.dev</code> is a TLD owned by Google, and they recently <a href="https://ma.ttias.be/chrome-force-dev-domains-https-via-preloaded-hsts/">preloaded HSTS rules for the TLD</a> which means you cannot use http with <code>*.dev</code> any more. Fun!</p>

<p>I decided to switch all my dev domains to <code>*.localhost</code>. (I also toyed around with adding self-signed SSL certs for each <code>*.dev</code> domain, with some luck on my home computer and less luck on my work computer. In the end I decided to just go with switching to <code>*.localhost</code>.)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown of things I had to do. Hopefully it helps someone.</p>

<p>I use dnsmasq to avoid having to edit <code>/etc/hosts</code> for every dev domain I work on. <a href="https://gist.github.com/szhajdu/6911696c6f8a2a50814fe6a5724f05bf">This gist</a> has the latest way to do this.</p>

<p>First, add <code>*.localhost</code> to dnsmasq setup:</p>

<pre><code>echo 'address=/.localhost/127.0.0.1' &gt;&gt; $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnsmasq.conf
sudo bash -c 'echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" &gt; /etc/resolver/localhost'
sudo brew services stop dnsmasq &amp;&amp; sudo brew services start dnsmasq
</code></pre>

<p><code>ping foo.localhost</code> for sanity to see if it works. May have to reboot if it doesn&rsquo;t. I did, but it may have been from other finagling.</p>

<p>I use Homebrew Apache and <code>mod_vhost_alias</code> (<a href="https://mallinson.ca/osx-web-development/">good tutorial here</a>) so open up the vhost config with <code>subl /usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf</code> and add this block:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;virtualhost&gt;
  ServerAlias localhost *.localhost
  VirtualDocumentRoot /Users/nate/Sites/%1/web/
  UseCanonicalName Off
&lt;/virtualhost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>sudo apachectl restart</code></p>

<p>We use Bedrock to make Wordpress development 17% less painful (note document root above with &hellip;/web/). The only thing you need to do is update your local <code>.env</code> file with <code>WP_HOME=http://cfs.localhost</code>. If you use the super handy <a href="http://wp-cli.org/">wp-cli</a> you can run <code>wp search-replace 'cfs.dev' 'cfs.localhost'</code> to update db references.</p>

<p>We have long been using this <a href="https://getgrav.org/blog/macos-sierra-apache-multiple-php-versions">excellent guide from Grav</a> as a jumping off point to set up our dev environments, which already has an update noting this change from Chrome 63.</p>
