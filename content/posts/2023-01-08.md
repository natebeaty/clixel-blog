I used to do these every few years, listing out all the software I use on a daily basis. But looking back at the last one I posted [ten years ago](https://blog.clixel.com/posts/where-i-live-2013-edition/) (gulp!), I realize not *that* much has changed. Sadly? Gladly? I'm not sure tbh. Good software is timeless software, apparently. Though as a developer, I know that keeping any sort of software afloat is a lot of work, no matter the platform, so I appreciate that some of these are still around, let alone still the best of their game.

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) (now at v4) is where Iâ€™ve now spent a good portion of my life for 12+ years. I know everybody's salivating over VS Code these days, but I recently gave it a shot, as well as another earnest go at Nova, and I just keep coming back to Sublime Text. It's so damn fast, and it has come a long way with context-aware autocompletes, especially for highly-custom codebases, which I spend most of my time in. I have a few sites that now stretch back nearly 20 years, and their quirkiness is welcome in ST-land, where VS Code and Nova don't recognize my weird brain patterns 90% of the time.</li>

- I'm glad to say that [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) has been able to totally replace Photoshop for me. (After leaving Firebelly in 2022, I lost my access to a CC subscription, and I refuse to give Adobe a monthly fee for their garbage apps.) I also keep up my registration and fire up <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a> for quick and dirty tasks. Both Acorn and Pixelmator Pro are super powerful options.

- I'm still using [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/) but since Elon has taken over Twitter, I've been spending more and more time over at [Mastodon](https://mastodon.art/@natebeaty), and look forward to Tapbots' Ivory client for Mac and iOS. In the meantime I've been using the very well crafted [Mastonaut](https://mastonaut.app), and the default Mastodon client for iOS.

- [Fork](https://git-fork.com) has taken over as my git client from GitX. They're very similar, but Fork has excelled at making everything a bit more elegant and streamlined. It's an amazing git GUI client.

- I've switched to mostly using Safari these days, because of how fast & lean it is, but it's probably 50/50 with Brave usage. I prefer how Brave handles View Source, and Safari drives me crazy how it so often doesn't handle a `*.localhost` domain, treating it like a search instead of always opening a local dev domain.

- I still use [ForkLift](https://www.binarynights.com) 24/7, now at version 3. It's an amazing dual-pane local/remove file manager, which I've used since I started these silly posts 13 years ago. I still pay for [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) (and Nova, which has Transmit built-in), but honestly never use it.

- I used The Hit List for ages, but it started crashing at some point, and seems to be abandoned by the folks that bought it (Karelia) about 5 years ago. I decided to finally give [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) a try, and haven't looked back. It's a very streamlined, opinionated to-do app that I love using on my Mac and iPhone (and Watch).

- [Sequel Ace](https://sequel-ace.com) has taken over for Sequel Pro, was it's regularly updated. It's pretty much the same thing, and still a great app for local mysql management, though I do miss the old syrup-drenched icon.

- I still pay for [CodeKit](https://codekitapp.com) but only use it on a few projects. Usually I have a gulp/webpack setup. Hilarious version update notes are still a bonus.

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) is still open 24/7 on my machine. I've tried various other terminals but always come back to iTerm.

- For notes, for several years I switched from Notational Velocity to using [The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/), but in the last year have been using [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) full time as a daily and archival note repository.

- For invoicing, I used [On The Job](https://stuntsoftware.com/onthejob/) for much of the last 10 years, but when Catalina came out it stopped working. After struggling with betas and frequent issues with slow updates, I ended up writing my own invoicing software, and have been using that since, even using it as a menubar app via [Unite](https://www.bzgapps.com/unite) which creates an app from a webpage (previously I used [Fluid](https://fluidapp.com) until that also stopped being updated).

- I've honestly been pretty disgusted with Apple software in the last few years, and Music is one of the worst offenders. [Doppler](https://brushedtype.co/doppler/) is a lean & focused local music player for Mac that I've been enjoying. The dev is super responsive and has added several features from feedback I've sent.

- Apple Mail is on the list because I've been doing my best to own my data. I deleted my Facebook, then switched from using gmail all the time to hosted email via nate@clixel.com on [Opalstack](https://brushedtype.co/doppler/) (which came about when WebFaction shit the bed), and recently even deleted my Instagram, which I'm still ambivalent about. Everybody's still on Instagram! But I kept finding myself hating time spent there, and the direction they've been going for years, chasing TikTok as if all services can't live independently and offer different services. Instagram was such a great site when it was solely focused on photography, with a dash of short-form video, all from your contacts. I miss old Instagram as much as I miss flickr now.
