<p>Yet another thing to file under &ldquo;beating my head against a wall for hours before figuring out something simple&quot;â€”argh!</p>

<p>I wanted to redirect all requests to https for a WebFaction-hosted site, and wasn&rsquo;t having any luck with the normal:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !on
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
</code></pre>

<p>I was getting &quot;too many redirects&rdquo; errors. After digging around I found mention of https redirects in (now-defunct) WebFaction docs with this code:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-SSL} !on
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
</code></pre>

<p>Note the <code>%{HTTP:X-Forwarded-SSL}</code> instead of <code>%{HTTPS}</code>.</p>

<p>Well howdy-doody it works now, hallelujah, back to more important coding matters like my <a href="http://codepen.io/natebeaty/full/yJdgpj/">giant SVG head navigation</a>.</p>
